\begin{abstract}
  Local fields, and fields complete with respect to a discrete valuation, are essential objects in commutative algebra, with applications to number theory and algebraic geometry. We formalize in Lean the basic theory of discretely valued fields. In particular, we prove that the unit ball with respect to a discrete valuation on a field is a discrete valuation ring and, conversely, that the adic
  valuation on the field of fractions of a discrete valuation ring is discrete. We define finite extensions of valuations and of discrete valuation
  rings, and prove some global-to-local results. 
  
  Building on this general theory, we formalize the abstract definition and some fundamental properties of local fields. As an application, we show that finite extensions of the field $\QQ_p$ of $p$-adic numbers and of the field $\laurentseries$ of Laurent series over $\FF$ are local fields.

\section {Discrete Valuation Rings}\label{section:dvr}

\subsection{Valuations}\label{subsection:valuations}
Let $R$ be a ring. A \emph{valuation} $v$ on $R$ is a map $v \colon R \to \Gamma_0$  to a linearly ordered commutative monoid with zero \fil{say what this is, perhaps spend a world on ``linearly'' and say that $0$ is smaller than everyhing} and  $\Gamma_0$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $v (0) = 0$,
	\item $v (1) = 1$,
	\item $v (x \cdot y) = v (x) \cdot v (y)$ for all $x, y \in R$, and
	\item $v (x + y) \le \max {v (x), v (y)}$ for all $x, y \in R$.
\end{enumerate}

For instance, when $R$ is a Dedekind domain of Krull dimension 1 with fraction field $K$ and $\m$ is a maximal ideal of $R$, we can define a function $c_\m \colon R \to \ZZ \cup \{ \infty\}$ \fil{we need to say that ``monoiod with $0$`` or ``monoid with infinity`` are the same thing...} by sending zero to $\infty$ and any nonzero $r \in R$ to the number of times that $\m$ appears in the factorization of the principal ideal $(r)$. Note that this number is well defined because ideals in a Dedekind domain admit a unique factorization into maximal ideals, up to reordering. We can extend the function $c_\m$ to $K$ by setting $c_\m (r/s) := c_\m (r) - c_\m (s)$ for any $r, s \in R$ with $s \ne 0$.

Then, for any real number $n_\m > 1$, it is easy to check that the function
$ v_{\m}\colon K \to n_\m^{\mathbb{Z} \cup \{-\infty\}} = n_\m^\mathbb{Z} \cup \{0\}$ sending $x$ to $n_\m^{-c_\m(x)}$ is a valuation on $K$, which we call the \textit{$\m$-adic valuation}. For example, when $R = \ZZ$, $K = \QQ$ and $\m = (p)$ is the ideal generated by a prime number $p$, $v_p$ is the $p$-adic (multiplicative) valuation on $\QQ$, also known as the $p$-adic absolute value.

Note that the choice of number $n_\m > 1$ in the definition of $v_\m$ is not relevant, in the sense that any two such choices will give rise to equivalent valuations. In our formalization, we abstract the codomain $n_\m^\mathbb{Z} \cup \{0\}$ using the type
\texttt{with\_zero (multiplicative $\mathbb{Z}$)}, denoted $\wzmZZ$,
which carries the multiplicative structure corresponding to the additive structure on $\ZZ$, as well as an added zero element.

For example, the rational numbers $20$ and $25$ have $5$-adic valuation $(-1 : \wzmZZ)$ and $(-2 : \wzmZZ)$, respectively, so $25$ is smaller than $20$ in the $p$-adic topology. \mi{Do you want to add anything else about this?}\fil{Probably, in the previous paragraph, I would add some of the main properties of $\wzmZZ$: something like $2+3=6$, that there are three elements $0:\wzmZZ,1:\wzmZZ=$\code{to_add}$0:\ZZ$ and \code{to_add}$1:\ZZ$ that are different, and some formulae with inequalities.}

We represent valuations in Lean using the \code{valuation} structure \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/valuation/basic.html#valuation}{\extlink}
 available in \mathlib, which encodes our above definition. A valuation on a ring $R$ induces a topology on $R$ for which the ring operations are continuous, hence turning $R$ into a topological ring.
Mathlib also provides the class \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/topology/algebra/valuation.html#valued}{valued}\fil{why not inserting the}
\begin{lstlisting}
class (R : Type*) [ring R] valued : extends...
\end{lstlisting}
\fil{?}
, which bundles together a ring with a
uniform space structure and a distinguished valuation that induces it. This class is designed for rings in which there is a canonical valuation. For example, on the field $\QQ_p$ of $p$-adic numbers, there is a unique nontrivial valuation, which we register as an instance of the valued class. By contrast, on the rational numbers there are infinitely many valuations, none of them preferred over the others, so we do not put a global valued instance on $\QQ$.

\mi{I would like to move this paragraph to section 2.2, after valuations in DVRs have been discussed }.\fil{I am fine with this: please move it to wherever seems suitable to you, putting the whole of it in the \code{\\mi} field, so that I will find it easily.} When implementing valuations on a discrete valuation ring $R$ with field of fractions $K$, we made the design choice to put an instance of the valued class on $K$, but not on the ring $R$ itself. The reason is that, if needed, we can recover the
topological structure on $R$ from the one on $K$, so we prefer not to duplicate this information. \mi{This choice is consistent with \mathlib's file \url{ring_theory.dedekind_domain.adic_valuation}, in which valued instances are only put on fields (should we mention this?)}

Given a ring $R$ with a valuation $v$, the \textit{unit ball} \mi {or  \textit{ring of integers}} of $R$ is defined as the subring $R_0$ of elements with valuation less than or equal to one. In \mathlib, this subring is defined as \code{valuation.integer R} \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/valuation/integers.html#valuation.integer}{\extlink}. If $R$ is a field, then $\ball{R}$ is a \emph{valuation subring}, that is, a subring such that for every element $r$ of $R$, either $r \in \ball{R}$ or $r^{-1} \in \ball{R}$.
To take advantage of the results about valuation subrings available in \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/valuation/valuation_subring.html#valuation_subring}{mathlib}, when $R$ is a field we rely on the declaration \code{valuation.valuation\_subring}\href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/valuation/valuation_subring.html#valuation.valuation_subring}{\extlink} to define the unit ball. This should not be confused with \mathlib's \code{valuation\_ring} \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/valuation/valuation_ring.html#valuation_ring}{\extlink} class \fil{should we explain the difference and the relation with this latter class with the \code{valuation_subring} one?}

\subsection{Definition of Discrete Valuation Rings}\label{subsection:def_dvr}
Our main reference for the general theory of discrete valuation rings are~\cite{Ser62} and~\cite[Chapitre~VI]{Bou85}. We refer to~\cite{Bou07}, in particular to \cite[Chapitre~IV]{Bou07}, for the main results about ring theory and commutative algebra that we will need.

Let $R$ be a ring, \fil{as above assumed} commutative and unitary. We begin by recalling the following equivalence
\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Chapitre~VI, \S3, n$^\circ$ 6, Proposition~8]{Bou85} and~\cite[Chapitre I, \S2, Propositions 2 et 3]{Ser62}}]\label{thm:dvr_tfae}
The following properties are equivalent:
\begin{listResults}
\item $R$ is a Noetherian local ring whose maximal ideal $\maxid$ is generated by a non-nilpotent element;
\item $R$ is a Noetherian local integral domain that is integrally closed and is not a field;
\item $R$ is a local PID that is not a field;
\end{listResults}
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
In~\cite[Chapitre~VI, \S3, n$^\circ$ 6, Proposition~8]{Bou85} other equivalent properties are listed, but we will not need them.
\end{remark}
A ring satisfying the equivalent properties of Theorem~\ref{thm:dvr_tfae} is called a discrete valuation ring (often shortened as DVR). The definition is motivated by the fact that a DVR $R$ can always be endowed with a class of valuations, 
\[
v\colon R\longrightarrow \ZZ\cup\{+\infty\}\fil{\text{ or use the mathlib convention?}}.
\]
For each of these valuations, the image $\image(v)\subseteq\ZZ\cup \{+\infty\}$ is the free monoid generated by $v(r)$, where $r$ is any generator of the maximal ideal $\maxid$ of $R$. Upon replacing $v$ by $v/v(r)$, for some generator $r$ of $\maxid$, we can assume that this free monoid coincides with $\NN$: in this case the valuation is said to be normalised, and the elements of valuation equal to $1$ are called uniformizers. One basic result is that, for a normalised valuation, the uniformisers are exactly the set of generators of $\maxid$, \fil{because \dots}. Moreover, there exists a unique normalised valuation on a DVR, since every valuation is uniquely determined by its value on the generators of $\maxid$. We denote it by ${\normalised}_R$, or simply by $\normalised$ when the DVR $R$ can be understood.

This point of view differs slightly from the classical one (as found, for instance, in~\cite[Chapitre~I]{Ser62} or in~\cite[???]{Bou85}), who \fil{only FALSE} consider the normalised valuation on a DVR, and regard it as being ``canonical''. This should not come as a surprise in the setting of a formalisation work: on the one hand, regarding ``the'' valuation as part of the data would \fil{rigidify the situation too much NOT NICE}, as in \fil{give a REF to some discussion in our DD paper about fraction fields} and, on the other, there might be different constructions of a valuation on a ring that would turn out to be propositionally equal albeit not definitionally equal. The corresponding pairs $(R,v)$, for the several possible constructions of $v$, would all be mathematically intercheangable yet represented by different, although equivalent types; this would lead to unnecessary verbosity while keeping track of the equivalences: in \fil{\S\dots and in \S\dots we will see explicit examples of this phenomenon, supporting our decision of avoiding the choice of a preferred valuation on $R$}. In particular, the definition we propose of a discrete valuation is encoded in the following class:
\begin{lstlisting}
class is_discrete (v : valuation A $\wzmZZ$) : Prop := (surj : function.surjective v)
\end{lstlisting}
This \fil{differs} from the usual definition (see, for instance~\cite[Proposition~I.1]{Ser62}), where one declares a valuation to be discrete when its image is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\ZZ$ (enriched with an element $\infty$), and observes that such a valuation can always be normalized to become surjective. In particular, with our definition, a valuation is discrete if and only if there exists a uniformizer, which we prove in the following form:
\begin{lstlisting}
lemma is_discrete_of_exists_uniformizer {K : Type*} [field K] (v : valuation K $\wzmZZ$) {$\pi$ : K} (h$\pi$ : is_uniformizer v $\pi$) : is_discrete v := sorry
\end{lstlisting}
together with the lemma \code{is_discrete_of_exists_uniformizer} proving the reverse implication. Similarly, the aforementioned correspondance between uniformizers for a normalised valuation and generators of $\maxid$ takes the form
\begin{lstlisting}
lemma uniformizer_is_generator ($\pi$ : uniformizer v) : maximal_ideal v.valuation_subring = ideal.span {$\pi.1$} := sorry
\end{lstlisting}
where the fact that the valuation is normalised becomes \emph{a consequence}, rather than an assumption as in the classical approach. For the same reason, in the declaration formalising the opposite implication, namely
\begin{lstlisting}
lemma is_uniformizer_of_generator {r : K$_0$} [v.is_discrete]
  (hr : maximal_ideal v.valuation_subring = ideal.span {r}) : is_uniformizer v r :=
\end{lstlisting}
the assumption that \code{v} is discrete --- implemented as the \code{class} assumption \code{[v.is_discrete]} --- becomes necessary.


Since a DVR is an integral domain, it is possible to extend the valuation to its field of fractions $K=\Frac(R)$ by setting $v(a/b)=v(b)-v(a)$ \fil{or...}. If the valuation $v$ on $R$ is normalised, we obtain a \emph{surjective} valuation
\[
K\longtwoheadrightarrow \ZZ\cup\{+\infty\}\text{\fil{or\dots}}
\]
whose kernel coincides with $\unit{R}$. \fil{With the definitions introduced in} \S\ref{subsection:valuations}, this turns $K$ into a discretely valued field. 


Both DVRs and valuations had already been defined in \fil{\mathlib SAY WHAT THIS IS SOMEWERE} before our project, but nothing beyong their basic properties was available. In particular, no definition of uniformisers or the relation between generators of $\maxid$ and the valuation on a DVR was available. More crucially, two fundamental constructions were not formalised in \mathlib nor, \fil{to the best of our knowledge, in any other proof assistant CHECK}: extensions and completions of DVR. The next section is devoted to a description of our formalisation of these \fil{notions? constructions?}.

We close this section by mentioning the result
\begin{lstlisting}
instance dvr_of_is_discrete {K : Type*} [field K] (v: valuation K $\wzmZZ$)
[hv : v.is_discrete] : discrete_valuation_ring $\ball{K}$ := sorry
\end{lstlisting}
Thanks to the above \fil{lemma/def/instance?},if $K$ is a field endowed with a discrete valuation $v$, its \fil{unit ball} $\ball{K}$ as defined in \S\ref{subsection:valuations} is itself a DVR. \fil{Should we say something about the proof?}. We then prove \fil{in the declaration\dots}
\begin{lstlisting}
bla bla
\end{lstlisting}
that the field of fractions $\Frac(\ball{K})$ has the structure of a \code{fraction_ring}$\mcode{\ball{K}}$ \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/ring_theory/localization/fraction_ring.html#fraction_ring}{\extlink} (we refer to~\cite[\S4.5]{BaaDahNarNuc22} for a discussion on how \mathlib treats fraction rings and, in particular, for an explanation of our choice of writing ``a fraction ring'' rather than ``the fraction ring/field''). Finally, we prove in
\begin{lstlisting}
\end{lstlisting}
\fil{that the unique normalised valuation on the DVR $\ball{K}$, once extended to its field of fractions $K$ as explained above, gives rise to a valuation that, up to rescaling, coincides with $v$ DONE?!?}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item True Math definition and the \texttt{mathlib\_tfae} (in particular, local and PID)
%	\item \texttt{is\_discrete} : observe that if the value group were $2\ZZ$ this would still be mathematically "discrete", but we make the choice of surjectivity in coherence with Serre/so that the notion of equivalence collapses to equality: there is a unique normalized one.
%	\item \texttt{uniformizer}'s and equivalence of their existence with discreteness
%	\fil{\item The unit ball of a field with a discrete valuation (be it valued or not) is a DVR; and the adic valuation (ref to María Inés' paper) on the field of fractions of a DVR \texttt{is\_discrete}}.
%\end{itemize}
\subsection{Complete Discrete Valuation Rings and their Extensions}\label{subsec:complete_DVR}
Suppose now that $R$ is a DVR. \fil{As discussed in \S\ref{subsection:def_dvr}, $R$ is a local ring of Krull} dimension $1$ that is a principal ideal domain (shortened as PID). Its unique maximal ideal $\maxid$ is a height-one prime, and one can consider the adic valuation associated to this prime, \fil{as defined, for instance, in\dots}. In fact, it turns out that since $R$ is a PID, it is in particular (\fil{see\dots}) a Dedekind domain: now, Baanen~\emph{et al.}~have formalised in~\cite{BaaDahNarNuc21} and~\cite{BaaDahNarNuc22} the general theory of Dedekind domains in \lean, and de~Frutos-Fernández \fil{is this the right paper?} has formalised in \lean the main properties of adic valuations on Dedekind domains and on their extensions. The main result connecting the two theories is that the $\maxid$-adic valuation $v_{\maxid}$ associated to the prime ideal $\maxid$ coincides with the normalised valuation $\normalised$ on $R$. Although this is mathematically trivial, and the two functions
\[
\normalised,v_{\maxid}\colon R\longrightarrow \ZZ\cup\{+\infty\}
\]
are considered identical in pen-and-paper mathematics, they actually belong to different types and hence are different terms. \fil{Indeed\dots WAIT FOR A THROUGHOUT DISCUSSION OF ADIC VAL'S} 

\vspace{3cm}

A pivotal construction in this context --- upon which the main application of the theory of DVRs and of local fields to algebraic number theory relies --- is that of the \emph{completion} of a DVR, or of its field of fractions, with respect to an adic valuation.

 and we can regard therefore $\maxid$ is its unique non-zero prime ideal. Hencee can regard it as 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The completion of a discretely valued field is again discretely valued (and so its ring of integers is a DVR by the above)
	\fil{\item The equality of the two valuations (the adic one coming from the max'l ideal, since DVR implies local) and the uniform completion of the valuation we begun with
	\item When viewing $K_v$ as the completion of $K$, its \texttt{valued} instance comes from the completion of the valuation on $K$, and this is of course different from the \texttt{valued} instance on the fraction field of $R_v$, itself isomorphic to $K_v$, that instead comes from the \code{discrete_valuation_ring} instance on $R_v$.
	\item Still, the isomorphism is known and one can compare the two valuations on $K_v$ which is \emph{a fraction field}; this is done in \code{v_1=v_2}.}
	\mi{\item Recall (María Inés' paper): there is a norm associated to a valuation; and if the field below is complete and the extension is finite, then this norm is unique (extending the one below).
	\item Speak about the work to define the normalized \texttt{discrete} valuation "above"
	\item [MAYBE] Mention the lemma \texttt{w\_le\_one\_iff\_disc\_norm\_extension\_le\_one}
	\item The proof (from previous project) and instance that a finite extension of a complete field is again complete
	\item The lemma \code{integral_closure_eq_integer} and the theorem \code{dvr_of_finite_extension}
	\item The extension of the valuation is not a valued instance because this would create a diamond for every valued field K. But we do get a DVR instance on the integral closure of the integers.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Local Fields}
Give our definition and the claims that finite extensions of $\laurentseries$ and of $\QQ_p$ are local fields.\\
The valued instance on a mixed/equal characteristic local field causes a diamond on $\QQ_p$ or
$\laurentseries$.
\subsection{Equal characteristic}
\begin{itemize}
	\fil{\item Unlike the $p$-adic, the completion of the ring of rational functions had not yet been defined in mathlib.
	\item Put both a valuation and a norm on $\laurentseries$
	\item iso between Laurent series and the completion}
	\mi{\item Definition of Eq char local field
	\item Our definition of ring of integers is the integral closure of $\powerseries$ in $K$, mainly to adapt to what has been done for number fields.
	\item The definition \code{ring_of_integers_algebra}
	\item $\laurentseries$ is an eq. char. local ring [(and also $\laurentseries[{\FF[q]}]$?)}

\subsection{Mixed characteristic}
\begin{itemize}
	\mi{\item Definition of Mixed char local field
	\item Our definition of ring of integers is the integral closure of $\ZZ_p$ in $K$, mainly to adapt to what has been done for number fields.
	\item The definition \code{ring_of_integers_algebra}, "equal" to the one for eq. char. local fields}
	\fil{\item Discussion about the two $\QQ_p$'s from a mathematical point of view.
	\item The proof that $\QQ_p$ is a mixed char local field.
	\item Say that most of the techniques used for the iso about Laurent series adapted to \code{padic_ring_equiv} IF TRUE}
	\item A proof that the ring of integers is a DVR (once $\ZZ_p$ becomes the right $\ZZ_p$ --- so, not only a DVR, which it is, but the \code{valuation_subring} of $\QQ_p$ --- this will follow from the general results about DVR's).

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Localizations of number fields are local fields
	\item Future work (not too much, but towards LCFT)
	\item Related works
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Implementation Details}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \mi{bundled vs unbundled \texttt{uniformizer}'s and the choice of having them in K or in R or in R.int\dots}
	\item \fil{insert here the "double" $Q_p$ in particular the fact we found a \code{metric} instance on $\QQ$}.
	\item \mi{the loop forcing the instance \texttt{discretely\_normed\_field} to be only a local one
	\item [MAY BE] Discuss working in $\wzmZZ$ vs in $\RR$ for the DVR\_extension
	\item The instance of \code{valued} at the end of basic is defined on THE fraction ring and not on A fraction field because otherwise this would get into a diamond. Look at the examples in \code{extension}. Observe that \code{height_one_spectrum.valued_adic_completion K v} takes as argument $K$ (that is A fraction ring of $R$), whereas \code{discrete_valuation.with_zero.valued} takes as argument a DVR (in this case, $R_v$). Since the completion at $v$ of the fraction ring $frac R$ is not equal to $K_v$, this leads to no problem.}

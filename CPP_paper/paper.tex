\section{Introduction}
\section {Discrete Valuation Rings}
\subsection{Valuations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Properties of valuations valued in $\ZZ_{m0}$, and the \texttt{multiplicative} and \texttt{with\_zero} classes, and clashes with "usual" intuition. Keep in mind that \texttt{with\_zero multiplicative} $\ZZ$ is "the same" as $q^{-\ZZ}\cup \{0\}$.
\item Difference between \texttt{valued} (which is a class, and carries a topology/uniformity) and \texttt{valuation} that is just a function.
\item We put \texttt{valued} instances on fields but "never" on rings that are not fields.
\item There is something called \texttt{valuation\_ring} that has (almost) nothing to do; but \texttt{valuation\_subring} has.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Definition of Discrete Valuation Rings}
\begin{itemize}
\item True Math definition and the \texttt{mathlib\_tfae} (in particular, local and PID)
\item \texttt{is\_discrete} : observe that if the value group were $2\ZZ$ this would still be mathematically "discrete", but we make the choice of surjectivity in coherence with Serre/so that the notion of equivalence collapses to equality: there is a unique normalized one.
\item \texttt{uniformizer}'s and equivalence of their existence with discreteness
\item The ring of integers of a field with a discrete valuation (be it valued or not) is a DVR
\end{itemize}

\item Related works
\end{itemize}
